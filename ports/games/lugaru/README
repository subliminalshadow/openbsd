After install, run as root:
chmod 0777 /usr/local/lugaru/Data/Users
so you can save your game progress.

If you encounter freezes, deactivate decals in the game options.

Game needs to be started from its directory located in
/usr/local/lugaru. Game binary is /usr/local/lugaru/lugaru.
To fix that, create a launcher /usr/local/bin/lugaru which contains:

cd /usr/local/lugaru
./lugaru
cd -

Then chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lugaru, and you're ready to play.
